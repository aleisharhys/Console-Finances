In this financial analysis challenge, I successfully implemented JavaScript code to analyze a provided dataset containing monthly financial records. The code calculates essential metrics, including the total number of months, net total profit/loss, average change in profit/loss, and identifies the months with the greatest increase and decrease in profits. Leveraging JavaScript fundamentals, I employed a loop to iterate through the dataset, performed necessary calculations, and printed the results to the console. The code is housed in a well-organized GitHub repository named "Console-Finances," following best practices for file structure, variable naming, and commit messages. The deployed application can be accessed via the provided live URL, showcasing the financial analysis results in a format consistent with the specified acceptance criteria.
